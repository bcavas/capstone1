          <h1>The Bench Press Done Right</h1>

          <p>The bench press is most commonly hailed as the king of all upper body exercises. While this is open for debate, the following tips on how to maximize it are not.</p>

          <ol>

            <li>Setup properly. Get the bar to eye level, arch your back, keep your butt on the bench and your feet planted firmly on the floor.</li>

            <li>Grip the bar in such a way that your forearms are perpendicular to the floor. Avoid flaring your elbows. Get your elbows in line with your wrists whenever you press. Wrap your thumbs around the bar.</li>

            <li>Keep your eyes fixed on a spot on the ceiling where the bar will end up at lock out. Doing so will ensure that the bar will travel in a straight path from your lower chest to that point in the ceiling.</li>

            <li>Breathe deep into your stomach (not your chest) and hold it, tense every muscle in your body, drive your shoulder blades into the bench, and unrack the bar.</li>

            <li>With your lower back arched, place the bar right above your lower sternum (at or slightly below nipple level).</li>

            <li>You can breathe in small sips through a braced mid section before you begin your descent but make sure that once you lower the bar you're full of air and fully braced.</li>

            <li>"Row" the bar straight down on the descent. Engage those upper back muscles. Don't let the bar free fall, exert full control.</li>

            <li>Touch the bar on your chest but don't bounce it.</li>

            <li>Initiate the press with 'leg drive'. Drive your feet as hard as you can into the floor while keeping your butt on the bench.</li>

            <li>Explode upwards like you're going to throw the bar to that spot you're staring at on the ceiling. You can exhale a bit of air when you're past your sticking point but only breathe at lockout.</li>

            <li>Be conscious of that arch and full body tightness. Don't ever lose any of those through the entire set.</li>

          </ol>

          <h2>Tips and pointers</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>Grip the bar as tight as you can. Imagine leaving imprints on the bar.</li>

            <li>Keep both feet planted firmly on the floor. Putting your feet up on the bench will lessen your stability, lessening the efficiency of the lift.</li>

            <li>If you're a beginner, DON'T use a false (thumbless) grip. Only guys who have years under the bar should do this and only if there are competent spotters watching.</li>

            <li>Lifters resort to a thumbless grip to alleviate shoulder pain from bench pressing. Using a closed grip on a fat bar will lessen shoulder pain from bench pressing while still maintaining safety. No fat bars at your gym? Get some Fat Gripz.</li>

            <li>Do not follow the bar with your eyes while pressing. This will make the bar go in different paths every rep and will make the bar path longer than it needs to be.</li>

            <li>Aim to bend the bar when you're pressing. This cue will help boost your pressing strength.</li>

            <li>Imagine you're reaching your back pockets with your lats. This will help ensure your back stays arched and your back muscles are active to stabilize the bar.</li>

          </ul>
